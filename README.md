This is the GitHub repository for 2021 Duke university Data+ Project 17 [Constructing Utopia in Restoration London](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/constructing-utopias-restoration-london).

# Project Overview
Who should get to decide what a utopian society looks like? After London was razed to the ground in the Great Fire of 1666, its reconstruction into the “emerald gem of Europe” was heavily influenced by the monarchy and aristocratic elites. In building a utopian epicenter focused on political and economic interests, immense sacrifices had to be made by London’s most marginalized citizens. 

Project team led by ([Professor Astrid Giugni](https://bigdata.duke.edu/people/astrid-adele-giugni) and PHD Candidate [Nicholas Smolenski](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/nicholas.smolenski)) will 
investigate those questions using machine learning algorithm.Undergradute researcher include: [Yuchen Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuchen-lu-2023/),

# Database
We used text from [EEBO-TCP Database](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebogroup/).
We filtered out 1600-1700 text using [teir2r package](https://rdrr.io/github/michaelgavin/tei2r/).To address spelling 
variation in Early English Printed Book, the project utilized [VARD 2.0](http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/vard/about/). We applied 50% threshold for
