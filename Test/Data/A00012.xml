            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritised, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic state character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Now hoped in quiet to have lived at last,</l>
            <l>Freed from his brothers hate and menacing,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Labans</hi> cruel gripes and coveting,</l>
            <l>His tears for loss of <hi>Rachel</hi> now were dried,</l>
            <l>For <hi>Dina's</hi> rape, and <hi>Simeons</hi> homicide,</l>
            <l>His sons abroad, in Peace their flocks do tend,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> at home, his father doth attend:</l>
            <l>When lo! an envious Spirit (which did reed,</l>
            <l>In holy <hi>Iacob, Isaacks</hi> promised seed,</l>
            <l>Which he to come of <hi>Ioseph</hi> most did fear.</l>
            <l>Because he to his father was so dear)</l>
            <l>One day amongst the sons of God appeared,</l>

            <l>Hee sees the Pleasures, never feels the smart;</l>
            <l>So as it seems it is thy determination,</l>
            <l>To make base Man for <hi>bliss,</hi> Vs for <hi>damnation</hi>:</l>
            <l>How hast thou blessed him on every side?</l>
            <l>His Children many, his Possessions wide;</l>
            <l>His flocks abound and cover all the Land,</l>
            <l>So thou dost bless all works that pass his hand:</l>
            <l>Well may he serve thee for so great reward,</l>
            <l>But touch him, thou shalt see his slight regard,</l>
            <l>Vex thou but him, or any of his race,</l>
            <l>And he will thee blaspheme unto thy face:</l>
            <l>When thus, the<hi>Almighty</hi>; say thou what thou can,</l>

            <l>Makes him all grief for <hi>Iosephs</hi> loss forget:</l>
            <l>And pleasure take in <hi>Beniamin</hi> now more,</l>
            <l>Then he in <hi>Ioseph</hi> ever did before.</l>
            <l>So doth one for his wife oft weep and cry,</l>

            <l>Who Corn had heaped up numberless like sand,</l>
            <l>And was the Ruler over <hi>Egypt</hi> land,</l>
            <l>When lo! the brethren ten before him brought,</l>
            <l>Low bowing to the ground, him thus besought:</l>
            <l>Great Lord! whose wisdom and deserved grace</l>
            <l>Giue's thee in <hi>Egypt</hi> even the second place,</l>
            <l>Whose Prudence, honour, glory and renown,</l>
            <l>Through all the habitable Earth is known,</l>
            <l>Vouchsafe to vs thy <hi>Servants</hi> now such grace,</l>
            <l>As thou hast done to many in our Case:</l>
            <l>We <hi>Brethren</hi> all, one mans <hi>Sons,</hi> come to buy</l>
            <l>Corn to relieve vs and our Family,</l>

            <l>We and our <hi>Race</hi> must die for want of Bread.</l>
            <l>The Lord of <hi>Egypt</hi> then who them did know,</l>
            <l>But was unknown, Himself strange rough doth show,</l>
            <l>And now remembering well his <hi>Dreams</hi> of late,</l>
            <l>For which these, that thus honour, him did hate,</l>
            <l>Thus answers: See! you have a fair pretence,</l>
            <l>To buy you Corn and Victual from hence;</l>
            <l>But you are come into the Land as Spies,</l>
            <l>To see wherein our strength and weakness lies:</l>
            <l>I'st like ten Brethren should so far descend?</l>
            <l>None left at home their houses to defend,</l>
            <l>Or are you all without a house or home,</l>
            <l>And masterless about the Country rome?</l>
            <l>Truly, saith <hi>Iudah,</hi> we twelve Brethren bee.</l>
            <l>All one mans sons, of which thou ten dost see,</l>
            <l>The least, at home, doth with his Father stay,</l>
            <l>But no man knows, where the other is this day:</l>
            <l>To buy food are thy <hi>Servants</hi> hither come,</l>
            <l>For vs and for our <hi>Families</hi> at home:</l>
            <l>By this, saith then the <hi>Prince,</hi> the truth I'll know,</l>
            <l>Whether you, as I say, be <hi>Spies</hi> or no:</l>
            <l>For, <hi>by the life of Pharoh,</hi> no man home</l>

            <l>Whilst of an answer they themselves prepared.</l>

            <l>Yea then, when they themselves think most secure</l>
            <l>For <hi>Iosephs</hi> wrongs, he poi's them home and sure.</l>

            <l>Which is to hate, forsake Sin, and repent:</l>

            <l>Alone with God, how he may best devise,</l>
            <l>Them for their foul offences to correct,</l>
            <l>And yet his aged <hi>Father</hi> not neglect,</l>
            <l>Whom fine he would relieve with store of grain,</l>
            <l>But fears his Brethren will not come again.</l>
            <l>The third day therefore, thus saith <hi>Ioseph,</hi> hear,</l>
            <l>Doe this and live; for I the Lord doe fear:</l>
            <l>If you be true men, as you all affirm,</l>
            <l>Leave one man bound, the rest all home return,</l>
            <l>With Corn for to relieve your Family,</l>
            <l>Then bring your brother, And not one shall dye,</l>
            <l>But traffic here as true men in the <hi>Land,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And I will free your <hi>Hostage</hi> from his Band.</l>
            <l>His word prevailed, But they in conscience</l>
            <l>Pricked for their cruelty, and foul offence,</l>
            <l>Long since committed against this <hi>Lord</hi> unknown,</l>
            <l>And thinking <hi>God</hi> now pays them with their own,</l>
            <l>Thus one to other to complain begin;</l>
            <l>Ah! how did we against our Brother sin,</l>
            <l>When his Souls anguish did to vs appear,</l>
            <l>And he besought vs, yet we would not hear:</l>
            <l>Therefore on vs, this trouble now doth fall,</l>
            <l>When <hi>Ruben</hi> thus; oh! did I not you all</l>

            <l>And all their speeches plainly understand,</l>
            <l>Who turns and weeps, yet soon returns again,</l>
            <l>So Friends afflictions tears from friends constrain.</l>
            <l>Then taking <hi>Simeon</hi> he him binds with bands</l>
            <l>Before their eyes: And secretly commands.</l>

            <l>Then all the Miles from <hi>Nile</hi> to <hi>Iordanes</hi> shore,</l>
            <l>As when ten horse men roving out for prey,</l>

            <l>Their hearts them failing, all are sore afraid,</l>
            <l>That they as <hi>Simeon</hi> likewise were betrayed:</l>
            <l>Ah! What, say they, hath God upon vs brought</l>

            <l>This thing upon vs all is justly come,</l>

            </l>

            <l>Have <hi>Ioseph</hi> slain; then to the <hi>Merchants</hi> sold:</l>
            <l>But when at home they to their Father tell</l>

            <l>And how that they for <hi>Spies</hi> were taken there,</l>
            <l>Imprisoned three days, and put in fear;</l>
            <l>And that the Man there still kept <hi>Simeon</hi> bound,</l>
            <l>Till by inquiry all the Truth he found:</l>
            <l>And seeing also every man bring back</l>
            <l>The money, which he carried, in his Sack:</l>
            <l>The good old man was wondrously afraid,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Simeon</hi> even as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was betrayed:</l>

            <l>Else where should you provide such store of grain,</l>

            <l>Such Visions are not like Dreams natural,</l>

            <l>God often by such Visions tells men plain,</l>
            <l>What things they ought to doe, and what refrain,</l>
            <l>Sometimes by Dreams to them are <hi>promised</hi>

            <l>And make my master see his foolish passion,</l>

            <l>Virtue to purchase, then preserve, no tide</l>
            <l>I slipped, but did most carefully provide,</l>
            <l>To kill all Vermin, cut off all excess</l>
            <l>Of Gluttony, and beastly Drunkenness:</l>
            <l>Abate all needless Beasts, Dogs, Mules and Horse,</l>
            <l>Rid idle Rogues and Vagrants, which are worse</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Catter-pillars</hi> to consume the store,</l>
            <l>To rob the richest and to starve the poor:</l>
            <l>No Corn out of the Land let I go out,</l>
            <l>But buy in rather from the Coasts about,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:19269:34"/>And many <hi>Forests</hi> which before did lie</l>
            <l>All waste, I unto <hi>Tillage</hi> did apply:</l>
            <l>Thus I proceed, and God so blessed my hand,</l>
            <l>That all things prosper over all the Land.</l>
            <l>But when the years of plenty all are past,</l>
            <l>And all the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> lies waste,</l>
            <l>So that they live of former years remains,</l>
            <l>Which them perhaps a month or two sustains,</l>
            <l>The people first of <hi>Pharoh</hi> seek supply,</l>
            <l>Who them to <hi>Ioseph</hi> sends; I suddenly</l>
            <l>Set open the Barnes, and sell for money out</l>
            <l>The Corn to all the Nations round about.</l>
            <l>Now is the time indeed, that I might buy</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Castles</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> for my <hi>Posterity,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But I all money bring to <hi>Pharohs</hi> hand,</l>
            <l>To be the <hi>strength,</hi> and <hi>sinews</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi>:</l>
            <l>If <hi>Pharoh</hi> will bestow on me a <hi>Place,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or money to buy <hi>Land,</hi> I of his <hi>Grace</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Will <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> as I my <hi>Office</hi> hold:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Strangers</hi> in purchasing may be too bold.</l>
            <l>When all their money's spent with buying bread,</l>
            <l>One year with Corn I them for Cattle fed:</l>
            <l>But when the next year they in need doe stand,</l>
            <l>I will for Corn their Bodies buy and <hi>Land,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>But all for <hi>Pharoh</hi>: whereby growing strong,</l>
            <l>He and his Empire may continue long:</l>
            <l>And to establish more his Segnurie,</l>
            <l>From <hi>Place</hi> to <hi>Place</hi> I will each <hi>Colony</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Transplant, who on the <hi>East</hi> of <hi>Nile</hi> abide,</l>
            <l>I will remove unto the other side:</l>

            <l>By <hi>Seisin,</hi> none shall say this is mine own.</l>
            <l>Thus have I seen when <hi>Want</hi> or <hi>Waste</hi> compel</l>

            <l>Whether he with his household may retire.</l>
            <l>Thus will I doe with all the <hi>Common Lands,</hi>

            <l>Or to <hi>Religious uses</hi> consecrate,</l>
            <l>I think it <hi>Sacrilege</hi> indeed to touch,</l>
            <l>Could all by this example learn as much:</l>
            <l>And let the <hi>Priests</hi> their <hi>Portions</hi> freely eat,</l>
            <l>Whose Brains in youth for understanding sweat,</l>
            <l>Their age in <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Persuasions</hi> spend,</l>
            <l>To save the Good, and wicked to amend.</l>
            <l>When I <hi>seven</hi> years have furnished them with bread,</l>
            <l>I in the <hi>eighth</hi> will furnish them with seed</l>
            <l>To sow their <hi>Land,</hi> The <hi>fifth</hi> of whose increase</l>
            <l>Shall be the <hi>Kings</hi>: The other <hi>four</hi> in Peace,</l>
