            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritised, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic state character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

UPON THE TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE
OF MARRIAGE BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TWEEN
ENGLAND
AND SPAIN.</head>
            <p>THe essential points thereof seem to be the
advantages, and disadvantages of such an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and whether both weighed in equal bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
the one will not oversway the other.</p>
            <p>The advantages that England may pretend are these.</p>
            <p>First, a great Kings daughter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, much money.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, safety.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, continuance of trade.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the bridling of the overgrowing greatness
of the States.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the Subjects of Spain will not be se bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome
to England being more remote, as those of
France would be that are nearer neighbours.</p>
            <p>Lastly, hindering the Scottish faction for strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it self by the alliance of France, which though
it be not publicly taken knowledge of, yet hath his
place among the reasons that further the match with
Spain.</p>
            <p>These and the like benefits and advantages some
promise to themselves by running the course of
Spain: but of God or his cause hitherto is made no
mention at all. And yet unless the Lord build the
house, the builders labour but in vain.</p>
            <div type="answer">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:14017:2"/>
               <head>The Answer</head>
               <p>The meanest of the household of faith are much
greater then those that are without, for they are borne
to a great inheritance: these are their promises.</p>
               <p>First God is their God, and with them hath he
made a covenant: nor ought it to be forgotten that
the house of <hi>Spain</hi> is stained with incest in the
match with the last King &amp; his own sisters daughter,
which cannot be but very loathsome to every true
Christians hart: and yet to speak according to the
world, the estate of England is great enough of it self
match it where it will, as it hath done in times past,
and as other great Monarchs have led the way. And
the alliance of France is near, and hath no ill aspect
upon England, and is as honourable as that of Spain;
that of France will not prove so beneficial, and so
neither so dangerous or prejudicial.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>dly, money will be soon wasted and melted away,
but the price of it will abide still: and let not any flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
themselves, Spain gives nothing but for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and where he gives much he looks for a
great return: Examine well their actions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
and make use of experience: whether can or
ought money to be an essential consideration to sway
the weight of so important an Alliance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, is not England stronger at this time and
Spain weaker then heretofore? where then is any
cause of fear? But allow that the state of England
stood in fear of any danger of Spain? will this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance
secure them? the fear is idle and the remedy
more idle, unless any could make it good that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14017:2"/>
love of Spain unto England (the match going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
would prove the predominant humour in him,
that should sway his ambission, whereof the world
hath so much experience to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Charles the fifth gave his own sister in marriage to
Francis the first: was Francis ever a whit the safer for
such an alliance?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Savoy</hi> hath married Spaines sister, who nevertheless
doth what he can to swalow him up.</p>
               <p>France and Spain have lastly made a double match,
ler it be examined whether Spain hath laboured
more to quench or kindle the fire in France; and yet
they are both of one and the same religion.</p>
               <p>They err who think there is any thing to be had
from a Papist for love rather then for fear, or that
Spain will ever dessist from aspiring to the universal
Monarchy of Christondome, and particularly the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of the uuited provinces: for though he often
strike sail and put into the harbour in foul weather
yet doth he not neglect to weigh anchor again, and
follow his intended course when the season is fit for
it. England doth hinder his designs; and therefore
would he match with England to have the fitter pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
for him: and if he were in quiet possession of all
the seventeen Provinces, then would they be made
a stable or store-house for all things necessary, in so
plentiful and well fitted a situation, for the invading
the parts near adjoining, whereof the plots are not
new, if England give way unto him, then (disapoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of their defences and Bulwarks) they will stand
(as it were) at his mercy and lie open to all manner
of batteries: as on the other side if he be crossed, then
will things be but where they were, both for conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14017:3"/>
and assurance against fear of invasion; nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
in so much the worse terms, because he shall
fail of his expectation, which commonly breeds
much harshness even amongst the dearest friends. Let
not any cast a mist in others eyes: though Spain had
left aside his wonted ambition (which none can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
assure) yet will he never loose his hope, or
relent in his resolution of recovering the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
wherein his honour and his reputation are so
deeply interested: nor can such a great scattered by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
that hath so many irons in the fire be but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
armed, and still in action to the danger both
of friends and foes, as he shall find his best advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and opportunities.</p>
               <p>If England fear Spain, their safety will rather stand
in keeping him at the staves end then in receiving
such an ambitious and new reconciled enemy and
doubtful friend into their bosom, where he shall
without blovves be able to doe them much more
hurt by his daily practice and corrupting of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jests,
then he can otherwise by open hostility, which
he will be wary enough not to attempt, lest they
joining their foarces by sea with those of the united
<hi>Provinces,</hi> should give him too great a shake. Strange
intelligence, and correspondence with neighbour
friends and allies will always prove a safer refuge for
<hi>England</hi> against <hi>Spain.</hi> And because all have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
quarrel to his Ambition and greatness, which in
him will never give way to any other consideration
whatsoever: for there hath ever been and will still
continue in <hi>Spain</hi> an endless ambitious desire of the
obtaining the western Monarchy where of a great
part of Christendom doth yet bear the scarre, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14017:3"/>
feel the stripes.</p>
               <p>4. Trade will be allowed to continue and as safely
without the Alliance of Marriage as with it: for <hi>Spain</hi>
doth not only reap a benefit by it; but also will be
afraid to scare or discontent <hi>England</hi> by the evil
usage of the Merchants. Else why have they so basely
and abjectly begged a peace: when<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>soever he shall se his
opportunity and find a greater advantage to break
then to continue in good terms with <hi>England,</hi> the
Alliance will secure the merchants no more, then if
it were not at all.</p>
               <p>5. The states may in time grow great, and their
greatness may grow dangerous; but <hi>Spain</hi> is both the
one and the other already; and this Alliance will ad
much unto it: there may also grow yealousy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindness
and thence open enmity betwixt <hi>England</hi>
and them, and so on the other side may the matter
be so discreetly carried, as they two may entertain
good amity and correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>dance one with the other for
common defence: for they both profess one religion
and their estate and condition seems to unite them
together in a necessity of putting out their hands
one to another for mutual preservation.</p>
               <p>Doe they carry themselves now unkindly or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
unrespectiuly? It doth not so urgently prove
that they may become enemies hereafter, as there
upon to ground a necessity of making an Alliance
with a known enemy, which were no other but to
run into a present mischief for fear of a future incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.
They take an Alarm at <hi>England's</hi> joining
with <hi>Spain</hi> to their hurt; which though it be not so
meant by <hi>England,</hi> yet it is the scope that <hi>Spain</hi> aims at
and that may make them perhaps somewhat to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14017:4"/>
neglect <hi>England,</hi> but remove the cause, and the effect
will cease, let them be assured of their friendship and
they will prove respectful friends: if they prosper and
grow great, who knows whether it be not of God,
by such weak means to pull down the loftiness of
<hi>Spain?</hi> and then to withstand them were to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against
a rock: the very first occasion of their liberty
was driving them to despair; which made them to
take hart and resolution to resist the violence that
was offered: wherein being encouraged with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
and feeling their own strength, they have in
time made such further progress as is this day to be
seen: better it were for <hi>England</hi> to make use of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
evil, and run a course with them whereby
they may have their part in their well speeding, then
to join with <hi>Spain</hi> (a religion and state enemy)
who Allied him self to <hi>England</hi> but for his own
ends, and must needs draw after them the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of the cause of religion and ruin the state: and
will never prove but a secret Enemy and doubtful
friend. And it must not in this place be forgotten that
if true professors be justly reproved for going to law
before heathen Judges, much less may they side
themselves with any of those that are without, to
the hinderance and hurt one of an other.</p>
               <p>6. If <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> should match to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
it doth not therefore consequently follow
that the French should become burdensome to the
State by reason of their nearness. The laws of
<hi>England</hi> allow no offices or preferments of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.
The french will have more hope in their own
Country where there is without comparison more
to be given then in <hi>England;</hi> the English seek
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14017:4"/>
not to make any fortune in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the French should be importunate they are
also impatient: let them find <hi>Visage de Boys,</hi> and
your coldness should wear out their earnestness.</p>
               <p>7. That the French with the Scottish faction may
gather strength by the Alliance of France is but a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
consideration: against which may be opposed
the greatness the Spanish faction will grow unto by
a match with <hi>Spain</hi> to the danger of the state: this
doth greatly lay open the value of such advantages as
<hi>England</hi> doth promise it self by matching with <hi>Spain</hi>
which how dearly they would notwithstanding be
bought will more perfectly appear, if knowledge be
also taken of the inconveniences and mischiefs that
would follow: for the better conceiving where of,
his ends are to be considered, and seriously examined;
for it is not likely that <hi>Spain</hi> a Religion and State Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,
who hath both religion and state quarrels
against <hi>England,</hi> will yield to give his Daughter in
Marriage to <hi>England:</hi> nay rather doth offer great sums
of money for composing there of; but that he looks
for a great return,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The price of this Alliance therefore will be the
breaking of the match with <hi>France,</hi> to the vveakning
of both <hi>England</hi> an <hi>France,</hi> whereby he may have
the greater footing in either, and the dividing <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
from his alices, especially from the States of the
united Porovinces, the making way for an other
match for his second son (whom he hath a plot
to settle in the low Countries, and from thence to
promote him (if he can) to the Crown Imperial)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14017:5"/>
with an other daughter of <hi>France,</hi> which would
give so great an Alarm to the whole state of those
of the religion, if the pretended match with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
come not between, altering in time the state of
Religion, whereof if he had no hope, neither would
he harken to the match: for none must think he
would treat such an Alliance without the privacy
and consent of his divines, or that they will give
their consents to that but upon great probability that
it shall tend to the furtherance of their catholic
faith. The supposed Catholic religion is known to
be in <hi>Spain</hi> one of the fundamental Lavves of their
estate: and no doubt <hi>Spain</hi> is a very right Romish
Catholic, the further therefore that he spreads
his religion, the greater satisfaction it is to his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and the more doth he underprop and increase
his greatness, namely because those of that religion
that are most devout, but especially the greatest part
of the Clergy throughout Christendom have their
eyes fixed on him, as upon the greatest stay and pillar
of their catholic faith: who therefore if he should
match with an heretic (for so they term us Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish)
but with a settled purpose by such means to
root out heresy, would both wrong his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and loose his reputation amongst all those of
his belief, to the over great vveakning of his estate:
which error none of sound judgment that knows
<hi>Spain,</hi> will easily believe that he will commit.</p>
               <p>That a change or toleration should happen in
<hi>England</hi> by means of the intended match, is more to
be feared then any can warrant to be impossible:
wherein it were well worth the labour to find out
what hope <hi>Spain</hi> doth ground upon, and what pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:14017:5"/>
there is that the same may be disappointed; in
the mean time very likely it is in general that there
will be no means unattempted, or left on his side,
to bring his purpose to pass. And then it must in
this place be remembered, first that vvhatsoever is
not of faith is sin, and that sin hath no promise of
blessing; nor is this a work of faith. And next that
<hi>England</hi> hath but too much experience of Popery,
with in these few years, for want of due execute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Lavves; which hath bread exceeding great
boldness in the papists, as well at home as abroad.</p>
               <p>If the marriage go forward they will take the more
hart and greater encouragement, no small number of
subjects want teaching, and so are the more easily
shaken, many waver, and many are newfangled the
more prepared for a change: &amp; therefore will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
be wrought upon. The old serpent will se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
many Eves, and pistols will have free passage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where. The worst is yet, that there will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
children: for the mother will give herself no
rest till she have nusled some of them in her own
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>, which would make the way very plain &amp; easy
for a change, because the head once corrupted, the
infection will in short time spread it self over the
whole body, and true religion is unsociable to sort it
self with false worship, and will soon forsake his
dwelling place.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Spain</hi> can procure a toleration of religion (which
must needs be followed with ruin of the State) he
may then assure himself of sides that will always
be able either directly or indirectly to divert the state
from hindering his designs<g ref="char:punc">???</g> as well in the low
Countries, as wheresoever else, and although he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14017:6"/>
should not prevail at the first by practis, or procure
a toleration of religion, which nevertheless the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing
number of Papists will of it self in process
of time effect, yet when he hath once a faction on
foot and that many of the subjects are perverted in
religion, he will notwithstanding be in good hope
that the state may be stayed, &amp; hindered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g> opposing
it self against his designs by the working of his factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>
&amp; the jealousy that will be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">??</g>ceaved of the Papists with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm: and whether his hopes will fayll him
or no, yet if he should upon such ground make any
attempt against those of the united Provinces, that
could not but fale out to the great troble annoyance
and danger of the state, especially if he send his forces
by sea; for then must <hi>England</hi> upon any such occati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
either rig out there Navy to sea to se that he keep
his course, which will always be a matter of great
burden and charge, or otherwise abide the danger
of his landing upon their own costs, if he have
intelligence with the Papists: wherefore it will be
always safer in such cases to be somewhat jealous
then too secure.</p>
               <p>Now the Alliance with <hi>Spain</hi> will not only scarr
and discourage in general, the whole side of those
of the religion abroad, to the great vveakning of the
state of <hi>England,</hi> but also breed a particular jealousy
in those of the united Provinces, when they shall se
that Popery increases, or that <hi>Spain</hi> hath a faction<g ref="char:punc">???</g>
or party in the Realm: whereof one of these two
mischiefs must consequently follow, either that
they will make their peace with <hi>Spain,</hi> or keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
many shipes of war in the narrow seas if
they be able to hold out, especially upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14017:6"/>
of any supplies by sea to the Artch Duke during
the Truce: which (as they are a people jealous and
suspicious enough by nature) may at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
by occationes happening grow to some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
inconvenience: for between two so near
neighbours both potent at sea, if there be not straight
amity kept, things cannot long stand without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth into terms of open hostility. And for the
state of those Provinces, though strong by sea, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and situation, yet are not the foundations of it
so far sure that <hi>England</hi> can with safety leave them
to themselves<g ref="char:punc">???</g> for the late sects and questions about
matters of religion threaten their disunion; and <hi>Spain</hi>
that lies continually in wait for their liberty hath his
pensioners and daily practicers amongst them.</p>
               <p>Some doe noise much the ancient amity with the
house of Burgundy, but that house is changed and
hath not kept struck in the conditions of the Alliance,
&amp; so ought the cause to be altered too. It was to weak
for France but now it is too strong, and <hi>England</hi> had
then plots against France which now it hath not<g ref="char:punc">???</g>
               </p>
               <p>The greatest use of Leagues and Alliances is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
present mischiefs, or to further some necessary
enterprise: otherwise reason of state and common
experience teaches to sway even with the weaker,
for the brideling of the ambition and greatness of the
stronger. They make an idle distinction who to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
the objections made against <hi>Spain</hi> pretend that
marriages are but personal amongst Preinces and not
real: for if there be no reality, where is then the
good of <hi>England?</hi> if there be any who is so weak as to
think that <hi>Spain</hi> will easily quit his interest in it.</p>
               <p>To allege the exampell of <hi>Erance</hi> that holds
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:14017:7"/>
correspondence still with his other Allies, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
to assist them against <hi>Sapyn,</hi> (notwithstanding
his match with <hi>Spain)</hi> is to as little purpose in the
judgment of those who doe also know how much
<hi>Spain</hi> prevayleth in weakening their sinews, and frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
the effect of such assistance.</p>
               <p>The sum is, that <hi>Spain</hi> hopes by reason of this match
so to charm <hi>England,</hi> as it shall give way to him in
his courses: and <hi>England</hi> contrariwise promises it
self the honey of the bee without danger of being
stung: whether of both may come short of their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coning
is at the least disputable. For <hi>Spain</hi> on the
one side will spare no travel or charge, will use all
the means and practises he can, and take the been<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of all occasions, and advantages that shall be off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to bring his purposes to pass: as it may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that <hi>England</hi> for his part will stand upon his
watch, to prevent a mischief that shall threaten
the state.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spain</hi> may (by a vigilant care and good foresight)
be disappointed: so may <hi>England</hi> by the contrary be
overtaken: for death will wear away these watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that are now, and others may succeed that will
not be so watchful: nay watchfulness it self over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watched
will in time grow drowsy, and overwearied
carefulness will grow careless.</p>
               <p>The very best cautions and caveats must needs
relent and wax old in time. In all strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
as well of the body as the mind, if one
side get ground the other loses it. Time will bring
forth many accidents which may fall out as to the
good, so to the hurt of <hi>England:</hi> who (that may
with good reason be feared) will not be watchful
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14017:7"/>
nor have his spirits always intent enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the practises of <hi>Spain</hi> after so strait Alliance, that
cannot now so much as foresee them, or resolve to
keep out <hi>Spain.</hi> Whereupon the question arises
whether it be a sound course for <hi>England</hi> (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by any urgent necessity) to put the cause of
religion, and their own well doing and safety to so
great an adversary, in a matter that stands upon so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
contingents. For it is no new experience that the
things which we think almost impossible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fear them least, doe nevertheless often come
to pass; because neglected, and so not hindered by
opposition, they creep unawares upon us as through
the mists of security. Well saith the Italian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Quell che non volete che sia non fate cos per che
avuenga.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, <hi>Spain</hi> who of late was thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
weak in the head, and wounded in reputation
by those of the united Provinces; yet having never
been more weakly balanced then at this present,
begins now to resume his spirits, and without
timely and strong opposition, will take so
deep root, and spread his branches so far,
as to overshadow all his neighbours:
and deadly dangerous it will be
for any one to sleep
in such a shade.</p>
