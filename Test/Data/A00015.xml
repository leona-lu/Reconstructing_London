            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritised, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic state character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For upon the Tuesday being the 20 of <hi>January</hi> last, as atoresaid, about nine of the clock in the morning, the Sun being most fairly and brightly spread, many of the Inhabitants of those Countries before mince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, prepared the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1310:3"/>
looking so their cattle finding therein, and so every one employed in his business as occasion required. Then they might see &amp; perceive a far of, as it were in the Eel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meant, huge and mighty Hills of water, tumbling one over another, in such sort as if the greatest mountains, in the world, had overwhelmed the lowe Ualeyes or Marshy grounds. Sometimes it so dazzled the eyes of many of the Spectators, that they imagined it had bin some fog or mist, coming with great swiftness towards them: and with such a smoke, as if Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes were all on fire: and to the view of some, it seemed as it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of thousands of Arrows had bin shot forth all at one time, which came in such swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as it was verify thought, that the Fowls of the ayre could scarce fly so fast, such was the threatening few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rios thereof.</p>
            <p>But as soon as the people of those Countries, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that it was the violence of the Waters of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Seas, and that they began to exceed the compass of their accustomed bounds, and making so furiously towards them. happy were they that could make the best, and most speed away, many of them, leaving all their goods and substance, to the merciless Waters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad to escape away with life themselves: But so violent and swift were the outragioue waives, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued one an other, with such vehemence, and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters multiplying so much in so short a time, that in less then five hours space<g ref="char:punc">???</g> most part of those cuntreys (and especially the places which lay lowe,) were all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for flown, and many hundreds of people both men wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children were then quite devoured, by these outrageous waters, such was the fury of the waives, of the Seas, the one of them driving the other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with such force and swiftness, that it is almost incredible for any to believe the same, except such as tasted of the smart thereof, and such as beheld the

same, with their eyes: Nay more, the Farmers, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondsman, and Shepherds, might behold their goodly flocks of Sheep, swimming upon the Waters dead, which could by no means be recovered.</p>
            <p>Many Gentlemen, Yeomen and others, had great losses, of cattle, as Oxen, Kine, Bullocks, Horses, Colts, Sheep, Swine, Nay not so much as their poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about their houses, but all were over whelmed and drowned, by these merciless Waters: Many men that were rich in the morning when they rose out of their beds, were made poor before noon the sane day: such are the Judgements of the Almighty God, who is the giver of all good things, who can and will dispose of them again at all times, according to his good will and pleasure, whenever it shall seem best unto him. Many others like wise, had their habitations or dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houses all carried away in a short time, and had not a place left them, so much as to shroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in.</p>
            <p>Moreover, many that had great store of Corn and Grain, in their Barnes and Garners in the morning had not within five boures space afterwards, so much as one Grain to make them bread withal: Neither had they so much left as a locke of Hay or Straw to seed their cattle which were left: Such was the great misery they susseyned by the fury of this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Element, from which like, good Lord I beseech him of his influ e mercy and goodness to deliver vs all.</p>

            <p>Moreover, all or the most part, of the Bridges, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Gloucester</hi> and <hi>Bristol,</hi> were all forcibly carried away with the Waters: besides many goodly buildings there abouts much defaced, and many of them carried quite away: besides many other great losses of al kinds of Corn and Grain, and cattle that were then lost.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Aust,</hi> many passengers that are Ferried over there now, are sane to be guided by guides, all along the Can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Many dead Carcasses, both there, and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there places, of the country, are daily found floating upon the Waters, and as yet cannot be known who they are, or what number of persons are drowned, by reason of the same Waters, which as yet in many places remain very deep: so great was the spoil that thiese merciless Elements there wrought and made.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bristol</hi> was much harm done, by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Waters, but not so much as in other places, many Cellars and Ware-houses, where great store of Merchandise was in, (as Wine, Salt, hops, Spices, and other such like Ware) were all spoiled. And the people of the Town were enforced to be carried in Boats, up and down the said City about their business in the Fair time there.</p>
            <p>Upon the other side of the River of <hi>Seauerne,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Town called <hi>Chepstow,</hi> upon the lower grounds, was much harm done, by the violence of the Water.</p>

Women, and Children, besides the loss of abundance of all kind of Corno and Grain: together with their Hay, and other provision which they had made for their Cattle.</p>
            <p>Moreover, there were in the places before mentioned, many thousands of Cattle, which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>And that which is more strange: There are not now found only floating upon the Waters still remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the dead Carcasses of many men women and children: But also an abundance of all kind of wilde Beasts, as Foxes, Hares, Connies, Rats, Moles and such like: some of them swimming one upon an others Beck<g ref="char:punc">???</g> thinking to have saved themselves thereby<g ref="char:punc">???</g> but all was in vain, such was the force of the Waters that over<g ref="char:punc">???</g>pressed them.</p>

            <p>But there placing her self for saueguard of her life as aforesaid, having none other refuge to fly unto: the Waters in such violent sort had so pursued her, that there was but a small distance of ground left uncovered with Waters, for her to abide upon: There she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned most pitifully lamenting the great danger of life that she was then in, expecting every minute of an hour, to be overwhelmed with those merciless Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: But the Almighty God, who is the Creator of all good things, when he thought m??ete, sent his holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to command the Waters to cease their fury: and so return into their accustomed bonuds again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by according to his most blessed will and pleasure she was then preserved.</p>
            <p>In the mean space, during the continuance of her abode there, divers of her friends practised all the means they could to recover her, but could not, the Waters were of such a d??opens about her, and Boats they had none, in all those parts to succour her, such was their want in this distress, that many perished through the want thereof.</p>
            <p>There was a Gentleman of worth, dwelling n??ere unto the place where she was, who caused a goodly Gelding to be saddled, and set a man upon the back of him, thinking to have fetched her away, but such were the d??opens of the waters, that he durst not adventure

the same, but retired.</p>
            <p>At last some of her friends, devised a devise, and tied two broad Troughs the one to the other, (such as in those countries they use to salt Bacon in) and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two lusty strong men, who with long Powles (stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these troughs) (as if they had bin boats) made great shift to come to her, &amp;  so by this means, through Gods good help she was then saved.</p>
            <p>But now (gentle Reader) mark what befell, at this time, of the strangeness of other creatures: whom the Waters had violently oppressed: for the two men which took upon them to fetch away the maid from the top of the Bank, can truly witness the same as well as her self to be true, for they beheld the same with their Eyes.</p>
            <p>The Hill or Bank where the maid abode all that space<g ref="char:punc">???</g> was all so covered over, with wilde beasts and vermin, that came thither to s??eke for succour) that she had much ado to save her self, from taking of hurt by them: and much ado she had to k??epe them from cr??e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping upon and about her, she was not so much in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Water on the one side: as she was troubled with these Vermin on the other side.</p>
            <p>The beasts and Vermin that were there were these. <hi>(Viz)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dogs Cats, Moles, Foxes, Hares, Conies, yea and not so much, as Mice and Rats: but were there in abundance and that which is more strange: The one of them never once offred to annoy the other: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were deadly enemies by Nature the one to an other: Yet in this danger of life, they not once offred to express their natural envy: But in a gentle sort, they freely enjoyed the liberty of life, which in mine opinion, was a most wonderful work in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But now let vs leave this matter touching this

maid, besides the other accidents before rehearsed and let vs return again to these watery miseries: The counties of <hi>Glamorgan. Carmarthen,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan,</hi> and many other places in <hi>South-wales,</hi> have likewise borne the heavy burden, of Gods wrath herein: And many were the lives of them that were lost through this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery destruction.</p>
            <p>Many there were which fled into the toys of high tree??es, and there were enforced to abide some three days, some more, and some less<g ref="char:punc">???</g> without any victuals at all, there suffering much cold besides many other salami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and some of them in such sort, that through ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much hunger and cold, some of them fell down again out of the Tree??es, and so were like to perish for want of succour. Othersame, sate in the toys of high Trees as aforesaid, beholding their wives, children, and servants, swimming (remediless of all succour) in the Waters.</p>
            <p>Other some sitting in the tops of Trees might behold their houses overflown with the waters. some their houses carried quite away: and no sign or token left there of them.</p>
            <p>Many of them might s??e, as they stood upon the toys of high Hills, their cattle pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>, and could not tell how to succour them, and their Barnes, with all their store of Corn and Grain quite consumed, which was no small grief unto them.</p>
            <p>Many people and Cattle in divers places of these Cuntreys, might have been saved in time, if that the cuntreys had been any thing like furnished with boots, or other provision fit for such a sudden Accident, as this was, which as God himself knows<g ref="char:punc">???</g> was little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of them to have fallen so suddenly upon them.</p>
            <p>But seeing the cuntreys were so unfurnished with Boats much harm was done, to the utter undoing of many thousands.</p>
            <p>Some fled into the tops of churches and St??apples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1310:7"/>
to save themselves, from whence they might behold, themselves deprived as well of all their substance, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of al their joys<g ref="char:punc">???</g> which they had before received in their wives and children, beware, whole R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kes of Peas, Beans, Dates, and other grain were seen a far of, to float upon the Water too and fro, in the Countries as if they had bin ships upon the Seas.</p>
            <p>The Foundations of many Churches and houses, were in a manner decayed, and some carried quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in <hi>Cardisse,</hi> in the county of <hi>Glamorgan</hi> there was a great part of the Church next the Water side ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down, with the Water, many houses and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens there, which were near the water side, were all ouerflowen, and much harm bone.</p>
            <p>Divers other Churches lie hidden in the Waters, and some of them the tops are to be seen: and other some, nothing at all to be s??en, but the very tops of the Steeples, and of some of them nothing at all, neither steeple nor nothing else. Also many schools of young scholars, in many places of those cuntreys, stood in great perplexitle, some of them adventuring home to their parents were drowned by the way: Other some staying behind in in Churches, did climb up to the tops of Steeples, where they were very near starved to death for want of food and fire: many by the help of boards and planks of Wood, swam to dryland and so were preserved from untimely Death, Many had Boats brought them, some 10 miles, some 15. some 20. where there was never seen any Boats before.</p>
            <p>Thus God suffered many of them to escape his ireful wrath, in hope of their amendment of life: Some men that were riding on the high ways were overtaken with these merciless Waters, and were drowned.</p>
            <p>And again many have bin most strangely preserved.</p>
            <p>As for example, there was in the County of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan<g ref="char:punc">???</g>
               </hi> a man both blind and did ride and one which

had not bin able to stand upon his legs in ten years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he had his poor cottage broken down by the force of the Waters, and himself, Bed and all carried into the open fields, where being ready to sink, and at the point to seek a resting place, two fathoms deep under the Waters: his hand by chance caught hold of the Raster of an house swimming by the fierceness of the Winds, then blowing Easternely he was driven safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to the Land, and so escaped.</p>
            <p>Also in an other place, there was a man Child of the age, of 5. or 6. years, which was kept swimming for the space of two hours, abone the Waters, by reason that his long Coats lay spread upon the tops of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and b??eing at last, at the very point to sink: there came by chance by, (floating upon the tops of the Waters,) a fat Weather that was dead, very full of Wool: The poor distressed Child perceiving this good means of recovery, caught fast hold on the Wethers Wool, and likewise with the wind he was driven to dry land, and so saved.</p>
            <p>There was also in the County of <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> a young Woman, who had four small Children, and not one of them able to help it self: And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there then seeing the su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Many more there were that through the handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of God were preserved from this violent death o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The lowe Marshes and Fenny grounds, n??ere <hi>Barstable</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon</hi> were overflown, so far out, and in such outrageous sort, that the country all along to <hi>Bridge-water</hi> was greatly distre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed thereby, and much hurt there done it is a most pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull sight to behold what numbers of fat Oxen, were there Drowned: what flocks of Sh??epe, what heads of kine, have their bin lost, and Drowned in in these outrageous Waters: there is little now remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there, to be s??en, but huge Waters like to the maine Ocean: The tops of Churches and St??apples like to the tops of Rocks in the Sea. Great Reekes of Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for Cattle, are floating like Ships upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and dead Beasts swimming thereon: Now past feeding on the same, through the rigour of this Element of Water: The tops of Tree??ees, a man may behold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining aboue the Waters, Upon whose branches, multitudes of all kind of Turkeys, Hens, and other such like Poultry were fine to sly up into the Tree??es to save their lives, where many of them perished to death, for want of relief, not being able to fly to dry land for succour, by reason of their weakness.</p>
            <p>This merciless Water breaking into the Bosom of the firm Land, hath proved a fearful p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
